Analyzing Financial Data and Election Data with Python

# Financial Analysis

First, I created a Python script that analyzes a budget in a .csv file to calculate the following:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset.
2. The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
3. The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
5. The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

Then, I exported the output to a text file called Finance.txt.

# Election Analysis

Second, I created a Python script that analyzes polling data in a .csv file to calculate the following:

1. The total number of votes cast.
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won.
4. The total number of votes each candidate won.
5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.

Last, I exported the output to a text file called Election.txt.

# Notes

The second analysis really shows how powerful Python is because the .csv file contained over 3 million votes. The script will run on any length with as many different candidates as there are, if they are in the same columns in the .csv file as the one I used.
